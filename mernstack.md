# MERN Stack Roadmap

A structured path covering core internet concepts, frontend development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, backend development using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and MySQL, along with essential tooling, version control, security practices, and deployment. Optional advanced topics include TypeScript, testing, Docker, and server-side rendering with Next.js. Suitable for real-world project development and SDE interview preparation.
