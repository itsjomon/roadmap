# Getting into [Zoho](https://www.zohocorp.com/) as a Software Development Engineer (SDE)

Skills Needed: Strong foundation in DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms), problem-solving, and core programming concepts.


## Apply for Zoho

**Options:**

- Zoho Careers Page: https://careers.zohocorp.com/jobs/Careers

- Referrals: Ask existing Zoho employees to refer you.

## Prepare for the Zoho Hiring Process

- Round 1: Aptitude + Programming Test
  - Basic aptitude + coding questions (Java).
  - Topics: Loops, arrays, strings, logic building.

- Round 2: Advanced Programming
  - Data structures-based questions (linked list, trees, recursion, etc.).
  - May include building small apps or logic-based problem solving.

- Round 3: Technical Interview
  - Focus on core subjects: OOPs, DBMS, OS, and some DSA.
  - May ask you to write code on paper/whiteboard or screen share.

- Round 4: Advanced Technical/Managerial
  - Real-world problems.
  - Projects you've done.
  - Tools and frameworks you’ve worked with (e.g., React, Node.js, Java, etc.).

- Round 5: HR Interview
  - General questions about your background, goals, Zoho culture fit, etc.


## Technical Round - LLD Oriented

These are standard LLD questions, search on YouTube to find solutions for the questions and do a Google search to find solutions, you can easily find articles or blog posts on the solution.

## Practice Resources

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/company/zoho/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://leetcode.com/company/zoho/) (for coding rounds)
- Zoho Previous Year Questions on PrepInsta, IndiaBix, etc.


## Topics To Focus 

1. Arrays & Strings (Very High Priority)
    - Searching/sorting
    - Subarray problems (Kadane’s algorithm)
    - Sliding window
    - Two pointers
    - Frequency count, anagram detection

2. Recursion & Backtracking
    - Factorials, permutations, combinations
    - N-Queens, Sudoku solver
    - String generation problems

3. Linked Lists
    - Reverse a linked list
    - Detect cycle (Floyd’s algorithm)
    - Merge two sorted lists
    - Palindrome linked list

4. Math & Number Theory
    - Prime check, GCD/LCM
    - Armstrong, factorial number problems
    - Palindrome numbers, base conversions
    - Bit manipulation basics

5. Stack & Queue
    - Balanced parentheses
    - Infix to postfix
    - Next greater element
    - Custom stack/queue implementation

6. Matrix
    - Spiral traversal
    - Rotate matrix
    - Search in 2D matrix
    - Island problems (DFS/BFS)

7. Tree (Moderate Priority)
    - Inorder, preorder, postorder traversal
    - Height of tree
    - BST insert/search
    - LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)

8. Hashing / Maps / Sets
    - Frequency maps
    - Duplicate detection
    - Longest substring without repeating chars

9. Greedy & Sorting Algorithms
    - Custom sorting
    - Activity selection
    - Interval merging

10. OOPs Concepts (Very Important for Interviews)
    - Class vs object, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation
    - Real-life examples of OOPs
    - Optional (If You Have Time):
    - Graphs (DFS/BFS for connected components)
    - Tries (rare in Zoho)
    - Dynamic Programming (very rare in Zoho interviews)
